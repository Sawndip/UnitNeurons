title: Unit Neurons Documentation - Overview
---

<h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>
    Unit Neurons is a repository for development of a C++ neural network library
    where each neuron is expressed using object instances which we refer to as
    "Unit Neurons".
  </p>

  <p>This documentation is written for Unit Neurons v1.0.</p>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/johnlime/UnitNeurons">Github Repository</a></p>

  <p>
    This documentation assumes that the reader has substantial knowledge about
    programming in C++, or basic operations (for loops, if statements, etc.),
    object oriented programming, and the usage of pointers.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is also advisable to have a basic knowledge regarding the neural network
    model that you are going to implement beforehand in order to have an
    understanding of the overall structure of your code; however, we have provided
    some example implementations and code for readers to take a look at.

    questions, comments, criticisms, etc.
